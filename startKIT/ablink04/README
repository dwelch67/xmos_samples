This actually took a lot of work, in part because I was fighting with
the simulator.

In theory a port resource can only be controlled by one core (at any
time).  They tied the 9 leds to one port resource.  So the idea was
to have one core actually drive the leds, and the other cores each
ask that core to change one of the leds.  One dedicated led bit for
each of these other cores.

The key here is events.  If you just use an in or testct or chkct or
something like that it is waiting for one single thing, well if we
want it to wait on many things and wake up on the first one you use
events (or interrupts).  Basically the waiteu instruction.  I have
one master thread and a few slaves one led bit each, they use their
own timers and ask the master to change the state of the led, all
running their own separate timeouts.
