Merry Xmos...Got my XMOS startKIT just in time for the Christmas
holiday.

So XMOS made a very smart move IMO.  A board that is affordable enough
for the masses.  And second have, or have attempted to (will see),
interface it to the Raspberry Pi.  Assuming the two work well together
they can easily blow away, performance wise for similar price, the
Arduino.  The XMOS part adds needed I/O in a way that is much better
than you would get with some simple single core microcontroller, without
having to get CPLD tools and learn Verilog or VHDL.  Understand that
the xc language (variation on C) can still take some learning.  And if
you get into the assembly I consider it to be for the advanced
programmers.

First impressions.

1) I am VERY VERY happy to see non-migraine producing green leds, it
is rare these days to see something other than painful blue or other
super brights.
2) There are a ton of holes for headers, although it will add some cost
($5?) they should seriously consider a board with if nothing else the
startKIT to raspberry pi connector, ideally all of the holes filled with
header pins.  By not doing this they are locking out the folks that are
not ready to take on soldering.
3) The header that mates up with the Raspberry Pi looks immediately
like it wants to be position near a corner so that you can use a
simple dual row female header and not have interference with components
on the Raspberry Pi board.
4) Did I mention how happy I was to not have to immediately remove and
replace the leds upon arrival?

Glad that I had a baggie full of header connectors.  After populating
two startKIT boards though I pretty much used up my supply of header
pins, so I have to order more...

I expect their web page to get re-architected over time, but here goes
as of this writing start here

Download the following:

startKIT Hardware Manual

From the schematic at the end of the hardware manual we see them
describe the part as XS1_A8DEV_64_FB217

The marking on my part is 8A6C5 which in the XCORE Device Part Marking
List is XS1-A8A-64-FB96-C5

So from that go here
https://www.xmos.com/en/support/documentation
Silicon Devices -> xCORE-Analog(A) -> XS1-A8A-64

Get these documents

The XMOS XS1 Architecture (ISA)
XS1 Ports Introduction
XS1-A6A-64-FB96 Datasheet

So the FB217 note in the schematics doesnt make sense.  It looks like
the FB96 doc is the one to go with...will see.

Ohh, how evil.  The part marking is supposedly bogus to throw us off
track.  It may be a XS1-U16A-128-FB217 with tile 0 and the usb being
used for us to talk to the board from our computer over usb and tile
1 is the one we get to play with.

Good, Bad, or Otherwise, I tend to find the best info about
XMOS parts from their various config files and not their docs.

You are going to need this anwyay

https://www.xmos.com/en/support/downloads/xtimecomposer

You will probably need a (free) account username/password to get the
installer.  Get it installed.  I run Linux (Mint as of this writing)
so once extracted I go to

XMOS/xTIMEcomposer/Community_13.0.1

and then

source SetEnv

from that directory and then I can get at the tools, to make sure
run xcc --version

xcc --version
Community_13.0.1 (build 11453, Dec-06-2013)
Compiler version: 13.0.1
Copyright (C) XMOS Limited 2008-2013. All Rights Reserved.

If it cant find xcc then you are not going to get very far.

So as of this writing in

XMOS/xTIMEcomposer/Community_13.0.1/configs

I see the file

XS1-UnA-64-FB96.pkg

In that file I see

        <Pin name="X0D68">
            <Port bitNum="17" core="0" name="XS1_PORT_32A" node="0" priority="0"/>
            <XLink bitNum="2" dir="in" node="0" number="1"/>
        </Pin>
        <Pin name="X0D69">
            <Port bitNum="18" core="0" name="XS1_PORT_32A" node="0" priority="0"/>
            <XLink bitNum="3" dir="in" node="0" number="1"/>
        </Pin>
        <Pin name="X0D70">
            <Port bitNum="19" core="0" name="XS1_PORT_32A" node="0" priority="0"/>
            <XLink bitNum="4" dir="in" node="0" number="1"/>
        </Pin>

From the schematic, we see
X0D70
X0D69
X0D68
X0D63
X0D62
X0D61
X0D58
X0D57
X0D56

are tied to the leds.  And that all seems to match, except that the
XS1-A8A-64-FB96 datasheet does not have these

X0D69
X0D68
X0D63
X0D62
X0D61
X0D58
X0D57
X0D56

The config file does though.  curious.

So the port is XS1_PORT_32A and these bits in that port are tied to leds

X0D70 is bit 0x80000
X0D69 is bit 0x40000
X0D68 is bit 0x20000
X0D63 is bit 0x01000
X0D62 is bit 0x00800
X0D61 is bit 0x00400
X0D58 is bit 0x00200
X0D57 is bit 0x00100
X0D56 is bit 0x00080

From the schematic the led is tied between 3.3v and the gpio port, so
making the pin high turns the led off (led has 3.3v on both ends, no
current) and making the pin low turns the led on (led has 3.3v on
one end and ground, 0v, on the other, current flows).

They way their code (and now mine) works all 32 bits in that port are
getting written to AFAIK, so it requires more investigation to know
what those other port pins are tied to and whether or not to run examples
that write the whole port (without doing a read-modify-write) if the
board is connected to something and not sitting there by itself.

Start with the figure8 example then ablink01 if interested.

Between the Raspberry Pi and startKIT documentation this is the pinout
for the connection

Raspberry Pi connector
pin raspi       startkit

1   GND         (nc)
3   SDA1        X0D49
5   SCL1        X0D70
7   GPIO_GCLK   X0D69
9   GND         GND
11  GPIO_GEN0   X0D61
13  GPIO_GEN2   X0D58
15  GPIO_GEN3   X0D57
17  GND         (nc)
19  SPI_MOSI    X0D0
21  SPI_MISO    X0D11
23  SPI_SCLK    X0D10
25  GND         GND

2   5.0v        (nc)
4   5.0v        (nc)
6   GND         GND
8   TXD0        X0D68
10  RXD0        X0D63
12  GPIO_GEN1   X0D62
14  GND         GND
16  GPIO_GEN4   X0D56
18  GPIO_GEN5   (nc)
20  GND         GND
22  GPIO_GEN6   (nc)
24  SPI_CE0_N   X0D51
26  SPI_CE1_N   X0D50

So the uart comes into the XMOS on X0D68 and out the XMOS on X0D63, the
Raspberry Pi spi connections are there, something to play with as well
along with some generic gpio.
